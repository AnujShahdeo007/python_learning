Exception Handling:

A controlled way to handle failures so your program doesn't crash suddenly. 

ERROR and Exception :

    - Syntax error: Code doesn't even start. 
    - Exception : Code starts running, but fails during excution (divide by zero,file not found )

Common exception :

1. ZeroDivisionError 
2. ValueError 
3. typeError 
4. FileNotFoundError 
5. KeyError 
6. IndexError 
7. ImportError/ModuleNotFoundError 

--- Python exception block 
    - try/except 
        - put "risky code" in try 
        - Handle the failure in except 

    - Multiple except block 

--- Catch-a;; (except as Exception as e)
    try:
        "risky code
    except Exception as e:
        print(" Someting went wrong")

    - Good for logging in production 

--- else 

    try:
        n=int(input("Enter number:"))
    except valueError:
        print(Invalid Input")
    else:
        print("Square is", n*n)

-- finally :
    - Always excute 

raise:
    - when you decide something is wrog and you want python to stop normal excution and throw some exceptio. 

Why we need raise :

    Python automatically raise errors like:
        - divide by zero 
        - wrong type 
        - file not found 
    rules:
        age must be >=18 
        salary cannot be negative 
        email must contain @ 

    raise ExceptionType("Error message")

    raise ValueError("Invalid input")



# Questions 

1. Take 2 numbers from user, handle ValueError and ZeroDivisionError 
2. Open a file name from user, print a content handle filenotfounferror 
3. Dictionary lookup: if key missing, print "unkonwn"
4. Create a function withdraw (balance,amount) and raise exception if insuffienicent
