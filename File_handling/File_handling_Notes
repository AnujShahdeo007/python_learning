File Handling 
-------------

1. What is file?
    - A file just saved text/data on your system(disk).

f=open("../input_data/test.txt","r")
# .. Go one folder up
# / path seperator 
data=f.read()
print(data)
f.close()

open():
    - Ask OS (windows/max/Linux) to give access to a file.

What is mode ( "r","w")

    For reading :
        "r" - Read text (default) - If file is not exist - Python throw error "FileNotFoundError"
        "rb"- read binary (images/pdf)
        "r+"- read + write 

Best practice:

with open (../input_data/test.txt","r") as f

read() : Reads everything 

    - Python reads bytes from disk through OS buffring.
    - converts to text using encoding (utf-8)
    - return one big string 

Use when file is small/medium 


2. readline() -> reads one line at a time 

    with open("","r") as f:
        line1=f.readline()
        line2=f.readline()
    print(line1)
    print(line2)

    Note: readline keeps \n (newline) at the end if present.

3. readlines() -> reads all lines into a list 

    with open("../input_data/test.txt","r") as f:
    line=f.readlines()
print(line)



Note: 

strip() : strip() is a string method, used to remove unwanted chacters from beginning and the end of string.

    - It removes spaces,tabs and newline 

Why do we need strip()
    - Extra space 
    - New line (\n)
    - Tabs (\t)
    - Messy user input 
    - Files with training spaces 


string.strip() 

lstrip : Removes charcters only from the left side. 

text="     Hello"

rstrip() : Removes chacters only from right side
