4.	Write a program to find the reverse of a number and also check if it is a palindrome.
5.	Write a program to find the largest digit in a number.

6.	Write a program to simulate an ATM withdrawal system with conditions:
	•	Minimum balance should be maintained.
	•	Daily limit applied.
	•	Invalid amount check.

7.	Write a program to calculate income tax based on slabs.

8.	Write a program to validate a password based on:
	•	Minimum length
	•	Uppercase, lowercase, digit
	•	Special character
