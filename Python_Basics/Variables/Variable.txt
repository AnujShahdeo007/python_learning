Variables:

What is a Variable?

Definition

A variable in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.
Variables are used to store data, so that it can be reused, updated, and manipulated during program execution.

x = 10

	•	x → variable name
	•	= → assignment operator
	•	10 → value stored in memory

Why Do We Need Variables?

Variables help us to:
    Store data
    Reuse values
    Make programs dynamic
    Avoid hard-coding values
    Improve readability and maintainability

Without Variable
print(10 + 10)

With Variable
num = 10
print(num + num)

Rules for Naming Variables

Python has strict rules for variable names.

Valid Rules
	1.	Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
	2.	Cannot start with a number
	3.	Can contain letters, numbers, underscore
	4.	Cannot use Python keywords
	5.	Variable names are case-sensitive

Valid Examples

name = "Anuj"
_age = 30
salary2025 = 80000
is_active = True

Invalid Examples

2name = "Anuj"      # starts with number
total-sum = 100    # hyphen not allowed
class = 10         # keyword

Case Sensitivity in Variables

Python treats uppercase and lowercase differently.

age = 25
Age = 30

print(age)  # 25
print(Age)  # 30
age and Age are two different variables.



Variable Assignment

Basic Assignment
x = 5

Assigning Different Data Types

name = "Python"
price = 99.99
is_valid = True

Python automatically detects the type.


Dynamic Typing in Python

Python is dynamically typed, meaning:
You do not declare data types explicitly.

x = 10
x = "Hello"
x = 3.14

Same variable x holds different types at different times.

Type Checking (type())

To check the data type of a variable:

x = 100
print(type(x))


name = "Python"
print(type(name))   # str

price = 99.9
print(type(price))  # float


Multiple Variable Assignment

Assign Same Value to Multiple Variables

a = b = c = 10

All variables store the same value.



Assign Different Values in One Line

x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

Swap Variables (Python Special Feature)

a = 5
b = 10

a, b = b, a

No temporary variable required 

Variable Reassignment

Variables can be updated anytime.

count = 1
count = count + 1
print(count)  # 2

Shorthand Assignment

count += 1
count -= 1
count *= 2
count /= 2

Constants in Python (Important Concept)

Python does not have true constants, but we follow a naming convention.

PI = 3.14159
MAX_LIMIT = 100

Written in UPPERCASE to indicate constant.

Variable Scope (Basic Intro)

Local Variable

Defined inside a function.

def show():
    x = 10
    print(x)


Global Variable

Defined outside a function.


x = 20

def show():
    print(x)


Deleting a Variable
Use del keyword.
x = 10
del x

print(x)  # Error

Common Beginner Mistakes

Using variable before assignment
Using keyword as variable
Wrong case usage
Confusing = with ==

if x = 10:   # ❌

correct 

if x == 10:


Real-World Example

Student Marks Program

name = "Anuj"
math_marks = 85
science_marks = 90

total = math_marks + science_marks
average = total / 2

print("Student:", name)
print("Total Marks:", total)
print("Average:", average)
